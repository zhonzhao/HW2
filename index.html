<h3>I Like Travel</h3>
<p>I am an undergraduate student who is crazy about travel and outdoor activities, but sometimes, I am professional business student just like what you see in my profile picture.</p>
<p>I was born in China. By the age of 15, I selected as a scholar to study in Singapore under full scholarship and that was the first time I visited a foreign country. My amazing journey started at that time. I represented my high school to participate a basketball tournament in Malaysia in spring 2008. At the end of 2008, I visited South Korea with my family.</p>
